# ToDoList
To Do List Repository for xPro course

Description: This is an exercise in using REACT to make a simple To Do List with the following features:
-Create a new To Do list item
-Read the list of all To Do items
-Delete a list item
All functions are within the browser and changes are not saved.

Usage: 
1. Download/copy the files and folders to a local folder. 
2. If using Node.js, open the command line point to the root folder of the target files, for example "cd path/to/ToDoList". 
3. Then run "npm install" to install all dependencies, and then run "http-server ./public" to start the server. 
4. Then view the page by navigating to the following URL in a web browser: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html" (default IP address and port number is shown). 

The list should include the following:
-Three items on the list (defined at the top of index.js)
-A minus sign next to each item, which is a button to delete that item
-A text box for adding a new item. The enter key is used to add the item to the list.
The output should look like this:

Roadmap: This exercise can be improved in the future by adding features to update existing items on the list, and connecting to a database to save new values and saved ones with the page load.
